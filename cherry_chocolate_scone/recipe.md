# Cherry Chocolate Scone 
based on recipe from [Sally's Baking](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/scones-recipe/)

the recipe uses dried cherries and chocolate chips as add-ins, but can be easily adapted for other add-ins 

## Ingredients 
1. 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour, unsifted 
    - the original recipe calls for 2 cups spooned and leveled. I usually just scope directly with measuring cup from the flour bag, the 1 1/2 cup is given for this method 
2. 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
    - can adjust to taste 
3. pinch of salt 
4. 1 teaspoon baking powder 
5. pinch of cinnamon
6. 1/2 cup unsalted butter 
    - cold, optionally frozen 
7. 1/2 cup heavy cream 
    - if using add-ins that release moisture or is wet, reduce heavy cream slightly 
8. 1 large egg 
    - straight out of the fridge 
9. dash of vanilla extract 
10. dried cherries, soaked in lemon juice or other liquid of choice 
    - soaking the cherries helps prevent the ones on the surface burning in the oven 
11. chocolate chips, to taste 

## Instructions
1. add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, cinnamon into a large bowl and mix 
2. cut the butter into small cubes, add to the flour mixture, mix, and working quickly, break the butter into very small pieces (about pea sized) using fingure tips. put the mixture in the fridge to keep it from melting 
    - if the weather is warm, consider putting the mixture in the fridge for 5-10 minutes half way through to stop the butter from melting 
    - the end goal is to maintain as many tiny solid butter pieces as possible when the scones go into the oven. cold butter pieces creates steam in the oven, which makes the scone flaky. puff pastries function on the same principle 
3. in small bowl, mix the heavy cream, egg, vanilla extract 
    - mix well to break up the egg white 
4. take the flour mixture out of the fridge, drizzle the cream-egg mixture over it, add the cherries and chocolate chips, and mix gently. adjust with more cream or flour to get the right consistency
    - the mixture might look too dry the beginning, but do not add more liquid until the dough is more-or-less evenly mixed 
    - the double should be slightly sticky, but holds shape well 
5. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, press into a rectangle ~4x8 in, cut into halves along the short side to end up with two squares, stack; press into 8x4 in rectangle, cut along short edge, stack again, and press
    - this help make the scone more flaky by pressing the butter pieces thinner, again, similar to puff pastries
    - this step can also be done with proper folds, but I find this easier 
6. divide the dough into 2 equal halves, and adjust each to roughly circular shape, and press to ~1 in thick disks, wrap in cling film and refridgate for at least 1 hour 
    - reshape dough by smoothing over the edges with hands. maintain orientation of the dough so the work we did in step 5 do not go to waste
8. pre-heat oven to 350 F with convection on 
7. take the dough disks from the fridge, one at a time, cut into 8 wedges, arrange on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, and brush the top of each lightly with heavy cream 
    - heavy cream help with colors and makes the top crunchier 
8. bake for 18 minutes
9. remove from oven, let cool on the baking tray for a few minutes, transfer to wire rack to cool completely 
    - scones taste best freshly baked and still warm, FYI
