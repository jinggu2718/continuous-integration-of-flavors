# Berry Preserve Muffin (Vegan Gluten Free)
based on recipe from [nora cooks](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-chocolate-chip-muffins/) and [Sally's Baking](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/berry-cobbler/)

## Ingredients 
### berry preserve 
1. ~1 lb of mixed berries, cut into small pieces 
2. 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
3. 1 tablespoon cornstarch 
4. squeeze of lemon juice 
### muffin 
1. 1 cup unsweetened soy milk 
2. 1 teaspoon apple cide vinegar or white vinegar 
3. 1 1/2 cup 1:1 gluten free flour, unsifted 
    - I don't sift flours, so 1 1/2 cup is for scooping directly with a measuring cup from the bag. the original recipe calls for 2 cup sifted 
    - most supermarkets have 1:1 gluten free flour in the baking isle
    - the recipe has not been tested with almond or oat flour, and probably won't work for them 
4. 1 tablespoon cornstarch  
5. 2 teaspoons baking powder 
6. 1/2 cup vegan butter, softened 
    - can be softened in the microwave in 15 seconds intervals on half power, stir btween each interval. if the butter ends up partially melted, simply stir it and it will come back to a smooth even consistency 
7. 1 cup granulated sugar 
8. pinch salt 
9. splash of vanilla extract 

## Instructions 
### berry preserve 
1. add the chopped berries and sugar into a small pot, cook on the stove on medium low heat for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, to let the berries release their juice 
2. dissolve the cornstarch in the lemon juice, mix until the mixture is smooth, add to the pot, stir until the preserve has thickened 
    - do NOT add the cornstarch directly to the pot. cornstarch clumps and sets very quickly when heated. adding the starch directly to the hot berry mixture will create lumps of solidified starch instead of thickening the preserve 
3. once the preserve have thickened, remove from heat, let cool, and store in the fridge 
### muffins 
1. combine the soy milk and the vinegar in a small bowl, stir, and set aside 
2. in a large bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, and baking powder, mix well 
    - we want the cornstarch and baking powder to be evenly distributed, so mixing them before adding the wet ingredients is a good way of doing that without overmixing the batter 
    - it is unclear if overmixing is actually harmful when using gluten free flour. the main objection to overmixing is that it increase gluten development, which makes the baked goods tough. however, if there is no gluten, it might not be an issue 
3. in a medium bown, mix the softened butter and sugar until slightly fluffy 
4. add the soymilk mixture, salt, and vanilla extract, mix 
    - the mixture will not be smooth, which is fine 
5. add the about half of the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mix until mostly combined, add the remaining liquids, mix until just combined. let the batter sit for a few minutes before baking
    - it is easier to mix a high viscosity composite evenly, because mixing relies on shear 
    - it is okay to still have some small lumps in the final batter. the main concern with lumps is that will create pockets of dry flour in the final product. this can be mitigated by letting the batter rest, during which time the lumps will absorb more liquid  
6. preheat oven to 350 F with convection 
    - the original recipe uses 400 F without convection 
7. line each cup of the muffin pan with a paper liner 
8. assembly: add some batter to each lined cups, spread the batter up the sides with a spoon to create a convex shape. add some berry preserve in the divet. using a spoon, carefully put down morre batter along the sides and then the top to seal the preserve in 
9. bake for 22 minutes. the muffins will still be quite pale with only slight browning along the edge. remove from the oven, let cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely
