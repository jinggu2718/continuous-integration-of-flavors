# Brownie 
based on recipe from [Sally's Baking](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/seriously-fudgy-homemade-brownies/)

## Ingredients 
1. 3/4 cup unsalted butter 
    - temperature doesn't matter here, because it will be melted later 
2. 4 oz dark baking chocolate bar 
    - do NOT substitute for normal eating chocolate bar. Baking chocolate has lower melting temperature, which makes it easier to work with 
    - I personally use 60-75% dark bars, but semisweet should work too 
3. 1 2/3 cups granulated white sugar 
    - exact amount can be adjusted to taste, the original recipe calls for 2 cups. Sugar contributes to both flavor and moisture in brownie, so lowering sugar to below 1 1/2 cup might start creating a noticeable difference in texture 
    - recommend using white sugar. I tried brownie sugar, and the molasses taste in brownie sugar does not work well with chocolate 
4. salt, generous pinch 
    - absolutely required. salt allow all the flavors to be tasted 
5. 3 large eggs, room temp 
6. vanilla extract, a splash 
7. almond extract, a few drops 
8. 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 
9. 1/2 tsp baking powder 
10. 3/4 cup all purpose flour, unsifted 
    - original recipe calls for 1 cup sifted, which is roughly 3/4 unsifted. Sifting not required 
11. chocolate chips, to taste 

## instructions 
1. cut the butter into small pieces, break chocolate into small pieces (no need to finely chop), and add both to a microwave-safe bowl. melt at half power in 15-30 seconds increments, let sit for a few seconds and then stir after each, until completely melted. while the mixture is still hot, stir in the sugar
    - make sure chocolate and butter are fully combined and hot. adding sugar to hot butter helps create the shiny crinkly skin on top of brownies 
2. stir in eggs, salt, vanilla, and almond extract, mix well. if the mixture is too hot, wait a few minutes before adding in the eggs 
3. add in cocoa powder and baking powder, mix well 
    - traditionally the dry ingredients are whisked together before folding into the wet ingredient. this is mostly to avoid overmixing, which encourage gluten formation and makes tougher cakes/cookies/pastries (doughs are kneaded for the same reason, to develop the glutens). however, we can add the baking powder with cocoa powder -- which do not contain glutens --  first, and mix as much as we want 
4. add flour and chocolate chip, mix until just combined 
5. preheat the oven to 300 F with convection on 
    - I bake with convection on because I have a gas oven that heats only from the bottom, and I found lowering the temperature and adding convection gives a more even bake. the original recipes calls for 350 F without convection 
6. grease a muffin tin, and fill each tin ~70%, smooth out the batter with a spoon. this recipe should yield 15-16 brownies, which requires baking in batches for most mortals 
    - the batter does not spread much in the oven, so it will need to be smoothed to produce conventional-looking brownies 
7. bake for ~18 minutes. the brownies should rise slightly (~25%) during baking 
8. Remove from oven and let cool in the tin for 5-10 minutes, then carefully remove from tin and let cool completely on a wire rack 
    - try rotating the brownies in the tins to loosen it 
    - the brownies have lower structure integrity then muffins because of the high cocoa powder percentage, so try to limit the applied loads and impact velocity when trying to turn them out of the tin
