# Honey Ginger Cake
based on recipe from [All Ways Delicious](https://allwaysdelicious.com/rosh-hashanah-honey-cake/)

## Ingredients 
1. 3/4 cup four, unsifted
    - scoop directly from the flour bag with the measuring cup. the original recipe calls for 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sifted 
2. 1 teaspoon baking powder 
3. 1/4 teaspoon baking sofa 
4. 1/4 cup honey 
    - dark honey tends to have a stronger and warmer taste while light ones (like clover) tends to be more delicate. I prefer dark honey for this cake 
5. 1/3 cup granulated sugar 
6. 1/3 cup brown sugar 
    - both sugars can be adjusted to taste, within reasons. sugar help keep the cake moist in addition to adding sweetness. this recipe uses vegetable oil instead of butter, and is quite moist in general, so can tolerate reduced sugar 
7. 1 large egg 
    - room temperature prefered, but not critical because we are not working with softened butter 
8. 1/3 cup cup vegetable oil 
9. generous pinch of salt
9. 1/3 cup black tea, cooled to room temperature
10. zest from 1 lemon 
11. juice from half a lemon 
12. 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 
    - fresh ginger has a lot more flavors than and tastes very different from ground ginger powder, do not replace with ground ginger powder
13. ground ginger, to taste 
14. chopped candied ginger, to taste 

## Instructions 
1. in a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda, mix until even 
    - we want the baking soda and baking powder to be evenly distributed in the cake without overmixing the batter, and combining the dry ingredients first is a good way of doing that. overmixing increase the gluten development, and can result in tougher cakes 
2. in a medium bowl, add the honey, both sugars, oil, egg, salt, fresh minced ginger, ground ginger powder, and lemon zest, mix until well combined. add the tea and lemon juice, mix until combined
    - we are combining the higher viscosity ingredients first to make mixing easier 
3. add about half of the wet ingredients into the dry, mix until mostly combined. add the remaining wet ingredients, and mix until just combined 
    - again, mixing relies on shear force, so it is easier to mix evenly with high viscosity ingredients. the final batter is quite thin, so we are adding only half the wet ingredients first to make mixing easier 
    - if the batter looks slightly lumpy, let it sit for a few minutes so the lumps of dry ingredients can hydrate and soften, before continuing to mix. this help reduce overmixing 
4. preheat oven to 300 F with convection on 
    - the original recipe calls for 350 F without convection. I have a gas oven that heats only from the bottom, so I lower the temeprature and add convection for a more even bake 
5. line a muffin pan with paper liners, divide the batter evenly between the cups, each should be about half full
6. right before putting the muffins into the oven, sprinkle the chopped candied ginger on top of the batter. bake for 25 minutes 
    - the batter is too thin to hold up the candied ginger, putting them on top help reduce the sinking 
7. remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool fully
