# Andes Mint Cookie 
based on recipes from [Two Peas & Their Pod](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/andes-mint-cookies/), [Sally's Baking](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/andes-mint-chocolate-cookies/), and additional science from [serious eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/cookie-science-how-do-eggs-affect-my-cookies)

## Ingredients 
1. 1 cup flour, packed 
    - scoop directly from the flour bag with a measuring cup 
2. 2/3 cup cocoa powder 
3. 1 tsp baking soda 
4. 1/2 cup butter, softened
    - can be softened in the microwave. cut the butter into pieces, place in a microwave safe bowl, and heat in about 15 seconds intervals on half power, stir between each interval. if the butter heats unevenly and ends up partially melted, simply stir it and it will come back to a smooth even texture, refridgerate if needed 
5. 1/2 cup grandulated sugar 
6. 1/2 cup brown sugar 
7. 2 eggs, room temperature 
8. pinch of salt 
    - required. salt help bring out the flavors of other ingredient 
9. splash of vanilla extract 
10. box of andes mint 
    - andes mint has particularly low melting point, other types of mint chocolate might not work as well 

## Instruction 
1. add the flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda to a medium bowl, mix with a spoon until even 
    - we want the baking soda to be evenly distributed in the dough without overmixing, which encourages gluten development and makes the cookie tough 
    - lumps in the cocoa powder can be hard to breakup, and it is fine to have some small lumps remaining in the mixture. they will hydrate when the dough chills in the fridge or in the baking process, and be unnoticeable in the final product 
2. add the softened butter and both sugars to a large bowl, beat with a fork until slightly fluffy 
    - can be (and is usually) done with a mixer
    - if mixing by hand as written here, make sure the butter is very soft so it can be stirred easily with a fork 
3. add the eggs, salt, and vanilla extract to the butter mixture, mix until smooth 
4. add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mix with a fork until just combined
    - the batter will be very wet, closer to brownie batter than cookie dough texture
5. cover with cling wrap and chill in the fridge for a few hours 
    - chilling the dough makes it easier handle 
6. preheat oven to 300 F with convection on 
    - the original recipes calls for 350 F without convection. I have a gas oven that heats only from the bottom, and I find reducing temperature and adding convection gives a more even bake 
7. line a baking tray with parchment paper. portion out the dough and roll to approximately 1.5 inch diameter balls, place on the lined baking tray with at least 3 inches in between (measured center to center) 
    - the recipe makes ~25 cookies, and require at least two baking trays for most mortals. recommend baking one tray at a time for more even bake 
    - the dough will be very wet and melts when handled. refridgerate the dough as much as possible when not activate working with it. luckily the temperature of the dough does not seem to have significant impact on the final product
8. baking for 9 minutes 
    - the cookies will spread and rise to form a dome while baking, but collapse when cooled. the surface should look dry but still very soft 
9. remove from the oven, unwrap the andes mints and place one on each cookie, wait for the mints to soften 
    - the surface texture of the mints will change from matte to slightly shiny as they soften 
10. using a butter knife or a spoon, start from the center and spread the melted mint outward over the warm cookie 
11. transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let cool completely 
    - the cookies are very soft, transfer carefully 
    - if the cookies are moved to the fridge before the chocolate topping sets, the surface might look "frosty" with a thin layer of white coating. the technical term is "bloom", and occurs because the large temperature fluctuation caused the fat in the chocolate to separate and recrystallize on the surface. it is still perfectly safe to eat, just looks worse, and in extreme case might impact texture. this is more of an issue with actual chocolates. andes mints have a lot of other ingredients in it and is more stable
