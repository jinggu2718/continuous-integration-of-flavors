# Lemon Cake Squares 
the original recipe called it lemon brownie, from [i heart naptime](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/lemon-brownies/)

# Ingredients 
1. 2 lemons 
    - the juice and zest will be need in both the batter and the glaze. there will be some left over juice at the end 
2. 1/2 cup unsalted butter 
    - temperature does not matter, will be melted later 
3. 2/3 cup granulated sugar 
    - can adjust to taste to some degree, but keep in mind that sugar contributes to both taste and moisture in this recipe, so decreasing sugar too much might cause the cake to be dry. the original recipe uses 3/4 cup granulated sugar
4. 2 large eggs 
5. pinch of salt 
    - salt brings out the flavor of other ingredients, add a generous pinch 
6. dash of vanilla extract, to taste 
7. 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
8. 3/4 cup flours, unsifted 
9. 3/4 cup powdered sugar 

# Instructions 
1. zest and juice the 2 lemons 
2. add ~75% of the zest into a microwave safe bowl. cut the butter into pieces and add to the bowl, microwave on half power in 15-20 sec increments, stir after each increment, until butter is melted. Grease an 8x8 pan with the butter left over on the wrapper 
    - the lemon flavor in the zest is oil based, this helps bring it out
3. add the granulated sugar to the melted butter, stir and mash it with a fork, until combined
    - mashing sugar with lemon zest is another classic way of helping release the flavor from the lemon zest. the sugar helps "break up" the zest and gets infused with lemon flavor
4. add the eggs, salt, vanilla extract, and a splash of the lemon juice, mix until combined
    - the exact amount of lemon juice doesn't matter, because lemon juice doesn't really come through in the cake after baking. I still add lemon juice mostly to make myself feel better
5. add the baking powder, mix well 
    - adding baking powder before the flour so we can get an even distribution without overmixing the flour and ending up with too much gluten development
6. preheat oven to 300 F with convection on 
    - the original recipe calls for 350 F without convection. I have a gas oven that heats only from the bottom, so I reduce temperature and add convection to get a more even bake 
6. add flour, mix until just combined. The batter will be thicker than normal cake batter, but thiner than brownie batter, similar to lemon curd in consistency 
7. transfer the batter to the greased pan, smooth slightly 
    - smoothing is not critical, the batter will even itself out while baking 
8. bake for ~20 minutes. remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes, turn out of tin, and let cool on a wire rack 
9. while the cake is cooling, make the glaze. in a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, the remaining lemon zest, and 1.5-2 tablespoon of lemon juice. adjust to desired consistency with lemon juice and powdered sugar
    - I personally prefer glaze on the thinner side so I use closer to 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, which gives me a pourable glaze with slightly transparent color. The orignal recipe uses 1.5 tablespoon lemon juice for a thicker glaze 
10. after the cake has mostly cooled, pour the glaze over the cake, and wait for it to set fully before cutting into squares
