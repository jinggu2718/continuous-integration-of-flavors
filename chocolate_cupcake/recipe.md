# Chocolate Cupcake with Whipped Ganache Frosting 
based on recipe from [Natasha's Kitchen](https://natashaskitchen.com/easy-chocolate-cupcake-recipe/)

## Ingredients 
### cake 
1. 1 cup flour, packed 
    - the conversion from packed to spoon-and-leveled is approximately 3:4 
2. 1 cup sugar 
3. 1/2 cup natural cocoa powder 
    - this recipe uses baking soda for levening, which requires acid to activate. Dutch-process cocoa is treated with akaline solution to neutralize its pH so it does not react with baking soda 
4. 1 tsp baking soda 
5. pinch of salt 
6. 1 cup room temperature coffee 
7. 1 tbsp white vinegar 
8. 1/3 cup neutral oil 
9. 1 egg 
    - temperature does not matter here. recipes usually call for room temperature ingredients when there is butter involved, to prevent the cold ingredients from partially solidifying the butter 
10. dash of vanilla extract 
### ganache
1. 8 oz. baking chocolate, finely chopped 
    - do not use normal eating chocolate. baking chocolate has much lower melting point than normal eating chocolate, and makes making ganache much easier 
    - chop the chocolate to small pieces, but do not grate it. grated chocolate is too fine and will float on top of the heavy cream and not melt 
2. 1 cup heavy cream 

## Instructions 
1. in a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt, mix well 
    - mixing the dry ingredients first helps evenly distribute them in the batter without overmixing 
2. in a medium bowl, beat the egg, add the coffee, oil, vinegar, and vanilla extract, mix well 
3. add the wet ingredient mixture into the dry, mix until just combined 
    - it is okay to small lumps of dry ingredients remaining 
4. preheat oven to 350 F 
5. line a muffin pan with baking cups, fill each cup to 2/3 full 
6. bake for 20 minutes 
    - the cupcakes should have good rise and might crack slightly on top 
7. remove from oven and cool fully to room temperature 
    - the whipped ganache frosting will melt if the cupcakes are not fully cooled 
8. add the finely chopped chocolate to a medium bowl 
9. heat the cream to just below simmering, and pour over the chopped chocolate. cover the bowl and let sit for 5 minutes 
10. gently stir the chocolate mixture until just combined
    - do not overmix. chocolate is basically a fat emulsion, and overmixing can cause it to separate 
11. let the ganache cool to room temperature, then whip at medium-high speed till light and fluffy 
    - the chocolate ganache will lighten visibly in color, and holds stiff peak 
12. decorate the cupcakes with the whipped ganache 
    - the whipped ganache works well for piping
