# Earl Grey Shortbread 
technically a misnomer, because this is a sable instead of shortbread, but sacrificing accuracy for ease of communication here.

based on recipe from [An Italian in My Kitchen](https://anitalianinmykitchen.com/sable-cookies/)

## Ingredients 
1. 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 
    - if the room temperature is too low, or if running short on time, the butter can be softened in the microwave. cut the butter into pieces, place in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat in 10-15 seconds intervals on half power, stir after each increment, until the butter is very soft. it is totally fine if the butter ends up half melted, just stir it until even, refridgerate for a few minutes if necessary. butter is a very unfussy ingredient 
2. 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
    - can adjust to taste
3. 1/2 cup powdered sugar 
4. salt, to taste 
    - necessary, add a generous pinch. salt helps bring out the flavor of other ingredients 
5. 4 earl grey and/or lady grey tea bags
    - I like to use a mix of earl grey and lady grey. lady grey is more citrusy and uses a mix of lemon and orange peels instead of bergamot, which adds a brighter note to the cookies
6. 2 egg yolks, room temperature 
    - eggs are easier to separate when cold 
7. 2 1/4 cup all purpose flour
8. milk chocolate chips, to taste 
9. dash of vanilla extract 

## Instructions 
1. cream the butter, add contents of the tea bags, both sugars, and salt, beat
    - the original recipe, and probably most recipes, says to do this with a mixer, but this step can actually be done easily by hand with a fork or even a butter knife, just soften the butter a bit more 
2. add the eggs yolks and vallina extract, mix well 
3. add the flour and milk chocolate chips, and mix until just combined. add extra flour if needed to get the right consistency 
    - the dough will be soft, but still able to be shaped. should be a bit stiffer than traditional chocolate chip cookie dough before it is chilled 
4. prepare two pieces of platics food wraps. divide the dough into two half, and shape each half into a rough log, place on the plastic wrap, and use the wrap to help shape each log into a rectangular prism with approximately 1.5x1.5 in cross section. wrap with the plastic wrap and transfer to the refridgerator to chill for >4 hours 
    - I like shaping the dough to prisms instead of the traditional cylinders because it makes cutting easier in step 6
5. preheat oven to 300 F with convection 
    - I bake with convention on because I have a gas oven that heats only from the bottom, and I found that convections option helps make the bake more even. the original recipe calls for baking at 325 F without convection 
6. remove the dough from the fridge, unwrap and cut into ~1/3 in slices. arrange on a parchment paper lined baking tray, leaving some space between cookies 
    - recommend using a sharp, large, heavy knife to cut the chilled dough, because it will need to cut through the chocolate chips without squishing the dough too much. also recommend holding the knife with one hand near the tip and another on the handle to help stabilize the knife 
    - the cookies will spread slightly while baking, so some space is needed between them 
7. bake for ~15 minutes. the bottom edge should start to brown slightly while the top is still pale 
8. remove from the oven and let cool on the baking tray for a few minutes before transfering to a wire rack and let cool completely 
    - the cookies will be very fragile when hot, so transfer very carefully. they will become more structurally stable as they cool 
    - the cookies might taste dry and powdery when they are warm, because the butter in it have not yet "set". do not panic, it will taste better once cooled
