# Almond Frangipane Brownie 
frangipane based on [the cafe sucre farine](https://thecafesucrefarine.com/ridiculously-easy-french-almond-frangipane-tart/)

Note that this recipe makes two 8x8 brownies 

## Ingredients 
### frangipane 
1. 1/2 cup butter, melted 
    - to melt, cut the butter into pieces, place in a microwave safe bowl, heat in the microwave on half power in 15-30 seconds intervals, stir between each interval 
    - butter is a very unfussy ingredient. it is totally fine if it melts unevenly, just stir and heat it. it needs to be fully melted anyway 
2. 1 cup sugar 
3. 3 eggs, room temeprature 
4. generous pinch of salt 
5. splash of vanilla extract 
6. splash of almond extract 
7. 1 1/2 cup almond flour 
8. sliced almonds for decoration, optional 
### brownie 
same as the [brownie](https://github.com/jinggu2718/continuous-integration-of-flavors/tree/main/brownie) recipe, but omit the baking powder 

## Instructions 
### brownie 
1. make brownie batter following instructions from the [brownie](https://github.com/jinggu2718/continuous-integration-of-flavors/tree/main/brownie) recipe, minus the baking powder. place the batter into fridge to chill 
### frangipane 
2. place the melted butter and sugar in a medium bowl, mix until even 
3. add the eggs, salt, vanilla, and almond extract, mix until well combined
    - if the butter is hot, wait till it is close to room temperature to avoid scrambling the eggs 
    - almond extracts are usually pretty strong, so be careful with the quantity. if necessary taste and adjust the quantity, keeping in mind that most extracts evaporate while baking so the final baked product will taste slightly milder 
4. add the almond flour, mix until combined 
    - do not worry about overmixing. the batter doesn't have any flour, so we are not worried about gluten development 
5. place into fridge to chill 
### assembly 
6. preheat oven to 300 F with convection on 
    - the original recipe uses 350 F without convection. I have a gas oven that only heats from the bottom, and I found lowering the temperature and adding convection gives a more even bake 
7. grease an 8x8 baking pan 
8. add half of the brownie batter, smooth it into an even layer 
    - the brownie batter can have a wide range of texture depending on how long it has been chilling in the fridge. if it is stiff, simply press batter/dough into the bottom of the pan like a crust. keep in mind that the batter will melt from body heat, so be mentally prepared for the batter to stick to hands 
9. add half of the frangipane, smooth into a roughly even layer, sprinkle on the sliced almonds if using 
    - does not have to perfectly smooth. the frangipane will melt in the oven and smooth itself out 
10. bake for 35 minutes. rotate half way through if needed 
    - the top frangipane layer should be light golden brown, and have risen a bit. it will sink back to mostly level once cooled 
11. remove from the oven, let cool in the tray for ~10 minutes. remove from the pan by flipping onto a cutting board, and then flipping onto a wire rack 
12. let cool to close to room temperature, then transfer to the fridge to chill for at least an hour before cutting 
    - chilling makes cutting easier. both the frangipane and the brownie layers are soft and quite sticky when warm, which makes cutting very tricky  
    - cutting tips: use a sharp knife, cut with high impact speed and determination. the layers are soft, so the almond slices can easily squish the cake if not cut through on impact. clean the knife if there are brownie stuck on it to avoid smudging 
    - the brownie still tastes best at room temperature 
13. repeat step 7-12 to make the second brownie with the remaining batters
