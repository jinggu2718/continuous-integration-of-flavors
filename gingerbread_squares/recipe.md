# Gingerbread Squared 
gingerbread cake squares with a brownie-like texture 

based on recipe from [Tastes Better from Scratch](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/gingerbread-cake/) 

## Ingredients 
1. 1/4 cup of granulated sugar 
2. zest from 1 orange 
3. 1/2 cup butter, softened 
    - to soften butter, cut it into pieces, place in a microwave safe bowl, heat on 50% power in 15 seconds intervals, stir between each interval 
    - it is completely fine if the butter ends up partially melted, just stir it until smooth, and refridgerate if necessary 
    - the softened butter should not give too much resistance when stirred 
4. 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce, room temp 
5. 1/3 cup molasses 
    - do not use blackstrap 
6. fresh grated ginger 
    - quantity to taste. I like ginger, so I use about 1 tbsp of grated ginger 
    - grate across the fibers of the ginger root to end up with a fine mush of ginger instead of long strands 
7. spices: cinnamon, ground ginger, clove, allspice, to taste 
    - cinnamon and ground ginger are by far the dominating spices. the ratio I needed up with is roughly 4:4:1:2
    - clove complements ginger well and is very strong spice. it tastes almost sour on its own and needs to be buffered by the other spices. So add it slowly, taste and adjust 
    - fresh and ground ginger taste very different 
8. vanilla extract, dash 
9. salt, generous pinch 
10. 1 cup packed flour 
    - I do not sift flour. 1 cup sifted / spoon-and-leveled flour is roughly 3/4 cup packed 
11. 1/2 tsp baking soda 
12. 1/2 cup hot water 

## Instructions 
1. add the sugar and orange zest to a large bowl, mash together with a fork 
    - orange flavors mostly come from the oil in the zest. mashing the orange zest with sugar helps release the flavor and distribute it through out the baked goods 
    - the sugar should turn slightly orange 
2. add the softened butter, mix well with a fork 
3. add the apple sauce, molasses, fresh grated ginger, spices, vanilla, and salt, mix well, taste and adjust the spices 
    - apple sauce needs to be room temp because it is being mixed with softened butter, and we don't want any cold ingredient to partially re-solidfy the butter 
    - when tasting and adjusting, keep in mind that the orange, fresh ginger, and vanilla flavors will weaken once baked 
    - it is fine if the mixture is not completely smooth, it will be fixed once we add the dry ingredients 
4. in a medium bowl, add the flour and baking soda, mix well 
    - mixing the baking soda and flour first helps evenly distribute the baking soda in the batter without overmixing 
5. add the dry ingredient into the wet, mix until just combined 
    - try not to overmix. mixing encourages gluten development, which can make baked goods tough 
6. add the hot water, mix until smooth 
7. preheat oven to 350 F 
8. grease an 8x8 baking pan 
9. pour the batter into the baking pan, smooth slightly 
    - the batter is thin enough to even itself out while baking, so it does not need to be perfectly smoothed 
10. bake for 20 minutes 
    - the gingerbread will rise a bit and dome while baking, but should fall back to approximately level while cooling 
    - a toothpick / skewer inserted into the middle of the gingerbread should come out clean 
11. remove from the oven, let cool in the pan for ~10 minutes. remove from the pan by inverting it onto a cutting board and then onto a wire rack 
12. let cool completely before cutting
