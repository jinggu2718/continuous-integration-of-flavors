# Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie 
based on recipe from [Preppy Kitchen](https://preppykitchen.com/oatmeal-chocolate-chip-cookies/)

## Ingredients
1. 1 1/2 cup rolled oats 
2. 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
    - butter can be softened in the microwave. cut the butter into pieces, place in a microwave-safe bowl, microwave at half power in 15-30 seconds intervals, stir between each interval. to fix partially melted butter, simply stir it, and it will come back to a smooth even texture, refridgerate if necessary 
3. 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
4. 1/2 cup brown sugar 
    - can adjust to taste, but keep in mind that sugar impacts both taste and texture. more sugar will result in a thinner and chewier cookie, less sugar will result in a thicker and drier cookie
5. pinch of salt 
    - salt helps bring out the flavors of other ingredient, and help cuts the sweetness 
6. ginger, cinnamon, allspice, clove 
    - to taste. I personally like a ginger+clove heavy flavor profile. clove has very strong flavor, so start with a small amount and adjust
7. splash of vanilla extract 
8. 1 egg, room temperature 
9. 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
    - do not substitute with baking powder. the use of baking soda here is to delay setting of the dough, make it chewier, and help with browning, which can not be achieved by baking powder
10. 3/4 cup flour, unsifted 
    - I am lazy and do not sift flours. 3/4 cup is for scooping directly from the bag with a measuring cup. the original recipe calls for 1 cup sifted / spooned-and-leveled
11. chocolate chips, measure with your heart 

## Instructions 
1. toast the oats. spread the oats on a parchment lined baking tray and toast at 300 F with convection on for 10 minutes. the oats should be slightly browned. let cool 
    - toasting the oast adds a warm nutty flavor to the cookies 
    - if the oven does not have a convection option, toast at 350 F
2. in a large bowl combine the softened butter and both sugars, mix with a spoon until well combined and fluffy 
3. add salt, spices, and vanilla extract, mix until combined. taste and adjust  
    - the mixture is just butter, sugar, and flavorings at this point, perfectly safe for consumption
    - keep in the mind when adjusting that we will add flour and oats later, which will dilute flavors
4. add the egg, mix until combined
5. add the baking soda, mix well 
    - most recipes whisk the baking soda and flour together before adding them to the wet ingredients, so the baking soda can be evenly distributed without overmixing (which encourage gluten development and results in tougher cookies). adding it to the wet ingredients does roughly the same thing 
6. add the flours, mix until just combined 
7. add the oats and chocolate chips, mix until the distribution looks roughly even 
8. chill the dough in the fridge for 1-8 hours 
    - chilling the dough hardens the butter which makes it easier to handle. some people claim that chilling the dough helps develop the flavors, but I have yet to test that claim. the oats will also absorb the moisture from the dough during this time, so longer chilling time will result in softer oats. I personally only chill it for 1 hour 
9. preheat the oven to 325 F with convection on 
    - the original recipe calls for 375 F without convection. I like to bake with convection on at lower temperature because my gas oven only heats from the bottom, and convection gives a more even bake
9. divide and roll the dough into 1.5-1.75 inch diameter balls, arrange onto parchment paper lined baking trays with at least 3 inches in between
    - this should results in 20-24 cookies, and needs to be baked in two batches. while the first batch is baking, keep the second batch in the fridge. colder dough spreads less when baking 
10. bake for approximately 9 minutes, adjust if needed
    - the cookies should be browned around the edges, slightly raisen in the middle (which will sink back during cooling), with the very center looking still wet. the cookies will set more while cooling
11. remove the cookies from the oven, let them cool on the baking tray for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to let cool fully 
    - or eat them while warm
