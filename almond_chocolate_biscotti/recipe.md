# Chocolate/Almond Biscotti
original recipe from Mark Drela in txt 

I have been informed that biscotti just means cookie, and the correct name for this type of cookie is cantucci, but sacrificing accuracy for ease of communication here 

alternative chocolate hazelnut biscotti: 
- replace almonds with 3/4 cup toasted hazelnuts, chopped coarse
- omit almond extract

## Ingredients
1. 6 tablespoons cocoa powder
2. pinch instant coffee
3. 3 tablespoons + 1 cup sugar, divided 
4. 2 cups all-purpose unsifted flour 
    - I do not sift flour, just scoop the flour directly from the bag. increase to 2 2/3 cup if using sifted flour
5. 1 teaspoon baking powder
6. 1 teaspoon baking soda
7. pinch salt
    - required. salt helps bring out the flavor of other ingredients 
8. 4 large eggs
    - 2 of the eggs need to be separated, which is easier to do when the eggs are cold 
    - the temperature is not critical since there is no softened butter or whipping involved 
9. generous splash of vanilla extract
10. splash of almond extract
11. 1/2 cup toasted almonds (whole or slivered)
    - If using whole almonds, chop them up to roughly 1/4" size pieces.
    - If using raw almonds, toast them at 350 F, for 5-10 minutes. eyeball the doneness based on color 

## Instructions 
2. in a medium bowl, put the 3 tablespoons sugar, cocoa powder, instant coffee, add in the 2 egg yolks, mix until combined. add a few tablespoons of water or other preferred liquid (milk, oat milk, etc.)  and mix until smooth. the cocoa mix should have the consistency of thick chocolate syrup, adjust with more water or cocoa powder if needed 
    - we add the egg yolks first because mixing relies on shear, and higher viscosity mixture have higher shear, making it easier to mix evenly
3. to the 2 saved egg whites, mix in 2 more whole eggs, vanilla, almond extract, set aside 
4. in a large bowl, mix flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, mix well
5. mix a few tablespoons of the flour mix into the cocoa syrup, until it have about the same consistency as nutella. it will stiffen slightly more as it rises from the baking soda and powder
6. add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, and mix thoroughly. it should have the consistency of wet cookie dough (prior to refridgeration), and still stirrable with a spatula/fork/spoon. adjust with more flour or water as needed. add the almonds and mix thoroughly 
    - I had to add quite a bit more flour in this step 
    - consistency of the dough is a tradeoff: dry dough is easier to handle, but gives denser  and tougher biscotti; wet dough is messy to handle, but gives lighter and crisper biscotti 
7. line a baking tray with parchment paper, preheat oven to 325 F 
8. generously sprinkle flour on a large cutting board / pastry mat. spread half of the almond dough into a 4" x 8" rectangle, oriented north-south. spread half of the cocoa mix evenly on top of the almond dough
    - to discourage the dough from sticking to the surface, before shaping it, push the dough ball around a bit to get a thin coating of flour on it, flip it and repeat to coat the other side as well 
    - I like to taper the dough slightly and start rolling from the narrower side, because the dough log elongates as it is rolled 
9. starting at the 4" south end, roll up the dough into a log. extend the log east-west into a roughly 12-16" length, either by rolling or simply by careful stretching with fingertips. sprinkle with more flour as needed
    - it will elongate somewhat as it's being rolled up, which is expected 
    - the rolling does not need to be very neat, the cocoa mix has some flour in it so will hold shape instead of leaking out when baked even if the roll is not sealed 
    - as the dough is rolled, try to dust off as much excess flour as possible to avoid having lines of dry flour in the final baked cookies
10. carefully transfer the dough log from the cutting board / pastry mat to the lined baking tray by rolling it or picking it up with hands+forearms. flatten the log to approximately 3/8 in thickness  
    - the dough log will be too soft to be picked up with just two hands, so creative methods are needed 
11. repeat step step 8-10 to make a second log with the remaining dough and cocoa mix
12. bake at 325F for 20 minutes
    - the dough should double in volume and starts to brown around the edges 
13. Remove from oven, and let cool
14. Using a serrated knife, slice each logs diagonally into 3/4" thick slices. place the slices back onto the baking tray standing with some separation between the slices to let air circulate between them 
13. Bake at 300F for 25-35 minutes, until the almond dough gets a hint of browning
    - the chocolate dough is wetter than the almond ones, so will take longer to dry out 
    - warm biscotti out of the oven might still be slightly chewy, but they will get crisper once cooled
