# Orange Chocolate Financier 
based on recipe from [Preppy Kitchen](https://preppykitchen.com/financier/)

## Ingredients
1. 1/2 cup unsalted butter 
    - temperature does not matter, as the butter will be browned 
2. zest from 1 orange 
3. 1/4 cup granulated sugar
4. 3/4 cup powdered sugar 
5. generous pinch of salt 
    - salt helps bring out the flavors of other ingredients and balance the sweetness. do not skip 
6. 4 egg whites 
    - egg whites freeze very well. Simply pour the egg white in a ziplock bag, squeeze out the air, and put in the freezer 
    - I usually make this recipe when I have 4 egg whites left over from recipes that only use yolks 
7. baking chocolate 
    - baking chocolate has much lower melting point than normal chocolate, so in general baking chocolate can not be substituted with normal chocolate 
    - I like to use dark chocolate, but other options should work too 

## Instructions 
1. brown the butter by heating it in a pan or small pot on medium heat, stirring frequently. the butter should melt, clarify, with milk solids percipitating, then foams. stir and scrape the bottom continuously once the butter starts to foam, and watch carefully as the milk solids start to brown. turn off the heat when the milk solids are somewhere between a dark rust color and brown. pour into a bowl (including all the milk solids) immediately to avoid burning it. let cool to roughly room temperature 
    - butter goes from browned to burnt very quickly, so watch it very closely 
    - browned butter can be cooled in the fridge to save time. if it re-solidifies, just put it in the microwave and heat on half power in 15-30 seconds increments, stirring between each increment  
2. in a medium bowl, add the orange zest and the granulated sugar, mash together with a fork 
    - mashing with sugar help release the oil in the orange zest and increase the orange flavor 
3. add the powdered sugar, almond flour, and salt, mix 
4. add the cooled browned butter, mix well 
    - the mixture will look very sandy and crumbly 
    - combining the dry ingredients with fat before adding liquid is referred to as "reverse creaming" sometimes, and helps make baked goods more tender, because the fat coating the flour deters gluten formation. here we are using almond flour, so the mixing order does not really matter 
5. add the egg whites, mix until smooth 
    - overmixing is not a concern in this recipe, because we are using almond flour, which does not have gluten 
6. preheat the oven to 300 F with convection on 
    - the original recipe calls for baking at 350 F. I have a gas oven that heats only from the bottom, so I use convection with a reduced temperature to get a more even baking 
6. grease a muffin pan, divide the batter between the 12 cups 
    - the cups will be only half full 
7. break the baking chocolate into large pieces, and stab a piece diagonally into each muffin cup 
    - the pieces does not need to be fully submerged, because it will sink more / the batter will rise around it during baking 
8. bake for 18-20 minutes 
    - the edge should be golden brown, but the top is still relatively pale 
    - the financiers should rise by >50% in the oven from the high liquid content, despite having no baking powder or soda 
9. remove from oven, let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan, and let cool fully on a wire rack 
    - because of the melted chocolate on top, the financiers can not be removed by inverting the pan. instead, insert a butter knife carefully along the edge, and "lever" the financier out 
    - to reheat the financier, microwave for 10 seconds and let sit for a minute to allow the chocolate to fully melt
